SMART CITIES - BACKEND TODO

DONE:
- Basic ML infrastructure (K-Means, DBSCAN, KDE).
- Data cleaning pipeline for NYPD CSVs.
- Prototype demographic parser for group-specific advice.
- Flask API with exploration and chat endpoints.

SHOULD BE CHANGED:
- Replace dummy/fake amenity data with real Overpass API queries.
- Shift from string-template "AI" reports to real LLM integration.
- Replace in-memory Pandas caching with a persistent PostGIS database.

LEFT TO DO:
- Integrate 311 complaints (Indicator of broken windows/risk).
- Implement advanced models (XGBoost for importance, ST-GCN for forecasting).
- Add uncertainty scores (Confidence intervals) to risk results.
- Create production endpoints: /personalized-risk, /compare-places, /safe-times.
