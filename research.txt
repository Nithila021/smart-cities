Yes, I can absolutely help with that. I’ve already done some web research on similar projects and apps; 
below is a structured overview plus concrete ideas for how you could differentiate your project by algorithm and features.

I’ll treat this as informal technical research, not legal advice. For a patent, you’d still need a proper prior‑art search and a patent attorney.

1. What’s already out there (high level)
From web search + general knowledge, there are a few big clusters of “crime/safety” products close to your idea:

A. Public crime maps & statistics sites
Examples (from search & known tools):

CityProtect / LexisNexis Community Crime Map – show official police‑reported crimes on an interactive map (cityprotect.com).
SpotCrime, CrimeMapping.com – pin/heat maps of recent crimes, basic filters by type/time.
Aggregator guides (e.g. SafeWise) list these as “check your neighborhood safety” tools.
Typical capabilities:

Map with icons / heatmaps.
Filter by date and crime category.
Often no advanced ML; many are just visualizations of raw incidents.
Little personalization, explanation, or “what do I do now” style advice.
B. Neighborhood “safety / livability score” sites
Examples:

AreaVibes, Niche, some real‑estate or insurance tools that compute a “crime/safety score” for an area.
Some products use a “Total Crime Risk Score”–style metric (one example screen in search mentions that phrasing).
Typical capabilities:

One global score per neighborhood (or ZIP code).
Usually a static index (per area), not trip‑ or time‑specific.
Often combine crime data with demographics, property values, etc.
Scoring method is usually opaque (not explainable to the user).
C. Real‑time alert & community safety apps
Examples (from search):

Citizen – real‑time incident alerts + live streams; “safety app” with 24/7 assistance.
Ring Neighbors – user‑generated posts about crime/suspicious activity, plus some police feeds.
Others (Nextdoor, etc.) with safety/crime discussion features.
Typical capabilities:

Real‑time notifications based on user location.
User‑generated photos/videos, comments.
Some basic risk messaging, but not deep ML analysis of long‑term patterns.
D. Academic / ML “smart city” crime prediction projects
From search:

Crime hotspot detection and future crime prediction with ML (e.g., “Crime Hotspot Detection and Future Crime Prediction using …”, 2025 paper).
“Machine Learning in Urban Crime Prediction” in smart‑city journals.
Work on interpretable ML models for urban safety.
Typical capabilities:

Use algorithms like:
DBSCAN / clustering for hotspots.
KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) for heatmaps.
Time‑series / spatiotemporal models for predicting future crime intensity per grid cell.
Often research prototypes, not polished apps.
Some focus on explainability and fairness, but usually in academic language, not user‑facing UX.
2. Where the gap is (opportunities to be unique)
Across these categories, there are some common weaknesses you can exploit for uniqueness:

Low personalization
Most tools give the same score/map to everyone, not tailored by:
Time of day you’ll be there
Mode of travel (walking, biking, car)
Your risk tolerance or context (tourist vs local, alone vs group).
Static, area-wide scores
Many systems give one “safety score” for a whole neighborhood/ZIP.
They rarely answer “How risky is this specific trip / activity at this time?”
Poor explainability
Users often see pins or scores but don’t understand why a place is considered risky or what concrete precautions to take.
Very little in terms of natural‑language rationales grounded in the actual data.
Limited use of rich urban data
Most consumer tools mainly use police reports.
Underused signals:
Street‑lighting, business opening hours
Transit stops and schedule
Event data (stadiums, nightlife)
311 complaints (noise, loitering, etc.)
Crowding/foot traffic proxies.
Fairness & de‑biasing not surfaced as a feature
There’s a legitimate concern that crime maps just reinforce stereotypes.
Very few tools advertise bias‑aware algorithms that try to de‑emphasize over‑policing patterns or avoid unfairly labeling whole communities.
Bridging from “information” to “action”
Many products stop at “here is a map.”
Less emphasis on:
Proactive route recommendations
Micro‑actions (“stand here while waiting for Uber”, “avoid this alley at night”)
Emergency flows that use the model outputs smartly.
3. Concrete uniqueness ideas for your project
Below are some specific things you could build in that would likely differentiate you, split into algorithmic and feature/UX angles. These are candidates you can later refine into something patent‑worthy with an attorney.

A. Algorithm-level uniqueness
Trip‑aware, time‑specific safety scoring
Instead of a static score per area, define a model that:
Takes as input: (origin, destination, planned time window, mode of transport).
Outputs:
Risk score for the trip.
Risk profile along the path (segments).
Uses:
Historical crime by time of day / day of week.
Proximity to nightlife spots, transit hubs, etc.
Novelty angle: explicit spatiotemporal path‑level risk model, not just a grid heatmap.
Personalized risk profile with constraints
Model learns a user’s risk preferences (e.g., hates poorly lit streets, wants to avoid robbery hotspots more than petty theft).
Algorithm:
Baseline city risk model.
Personalization layer that reweights factors based on a user profile while enforcing fairness constraints (e.g., can’t just mark entire demographic areas as unsafe).
Novelty angle: multi‑objective optimization: safety vs. travel time vs. user preferences, with fairness constraints.
Explainable hybrid model (ML + rule engine)
You’re already using clustering (DBSCAN/KMeans).
Add a layer that:
Translates cluster stats into semi‑templated explanations:
“This block has a high density of late‑night assaults between 11pm–3am, mostly on weekends.”
Uses a rule engine to attach specific advice:
“Avoid walking alone after midnight; prefer routes along main avenues.”
Novelty angle: pipeline that couples unsupervised clustering with an explanation generator that is data‑linked, not generic.
Uncertainty‑aware safety scores
Instead of a single score, compute risk + confidence interval.
E.g., “Score: 7/10 (high risk), confidence: medium (few recent reports).”
Use Bayesian or ensemble methods to estimate uncertainty.
Novelty angle: treating data sparsity and uncertainty as first‑class outputs and exposing them to the user.
Bias‑mitigated risk weighting
Build an explicit algorithm that:
Detects over‑policing signals (e.g., disproportionate number of low‑severity stops vs. serious crimes).
Down‑weights those counts in certain models.
Uses non‑crime urban features (lighting, land use, business density) to “stabilize” risk estimates.
Novelty angle: fairness‑aware safety scoring where the mathematical procedure is defined (and could be claimed) rather than being an afterthought.
B. Feature / UX-level uniqueness
Scenario comparison: “What if I go at a different time?”
Let users compare plans:
“If I go at 7pm vs 1am, how does the risk curve change?”
Feature:
Two or three alternative time windows.
Model recalculates and compares risk with clear visual and textual summary.
This is a simple UI, but backed by your spatiotemporal model.
Actionable micro‑advice + emergency integration
You already have an emergency button idea.
Extend it with:
Context‑aware emergency message templates that pull:
Nearest safe landmark
Nearest open business / 24h spot.
“If things go bad now, where is the safest nearby place to move to?” using your model.
This goes beyond “copy my coordinates” into decision-support.
Safety coaching mode for tourists/newcomers
Instead of just “safe/unsafe,” provide:
Short checklists per area type: nightlife district, business district, residential.
“First time here” tips based on historical patterns (not stereotypes).
Could be tied to your clusters (zone types) with pre‑authored guidelines.
Multi‑city normalization
Many tools are city‑specific.
Define a method that normalizes risk between cities (e.g., NYC vs Chicago) so the same score means roughly the same percentile risk.
Novelty angle: cross‑city calibration algorithm using national crime benchmarks.
4. How to turn this into something patent‑ready
To move toward a patent, you’ll want to crystallize 1–2 of these ideas into something more formal:

Define the pipeline clearly
Data inputs (types, sources, spatial/temporal aggregation).
Core model structure (e.g., grid‑based time series + clustering + rule engine).
How outputs are computed (trip‑level risk, uncertainty bands, explanations).
Highlight what’s different compared to “normal” approaches
Example: “Unlike typical crime maps that only show pins/heatmaps from historical incidents, our system computes a route‑ and time‑specific risk score with personalized weighting and explicit uncertainty estimates, coupled with an explanation generator that maps cluster statistics to actionable, contextualized advice.”
Document a couple of example use‑cases
“Solo traveler walking from A to B at 11pm in midtown Manhattan.”
“Parent evaluating school pickup route at 3pm.”
Show how the algorithm behaves differently and better than a simple heatmap.
Engage a patent professional
Use what we write together as a technical draft.
A patent attorney can:
Do a proper search in USPTO/EPO/other databases.
Shape the claims language to emphasize the unique algorithmic aspects.
5. Next step – tailoring to your project
To get more specific and actionable, it would help to know:

Do you want your uniqueness primarily from the algorithm, the UX/features, or a combination?
Are you planning to stay NYC‑only, or expand to multiple cities?
Which of the above ideas feel most natural for you to implement with your current stack (Python + Flask + React + clustering models)?
If you answer those, I can:

Propose a concrete algorithm design (step‑by‑step, matching your current codebase).
Help you draft a short “novelty description” you could bring to a patent attorney.
